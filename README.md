# Intel---Cervical Cancer
Kaggle Competition for Intel

Part 1: Design an algorithm that identifies a woman's cervix type based on images.
We are given 4000 high resolution jpg images of cervix of various sizes and asked to identify the 3 cervix types that are defined by their transformation zones. 

## Introduction

Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women worldwide and the most common in developing countries/ However cervival cancer incidence and mortality remains high in developing countries due to the complexity and cost of high quality pap screening programs. Here there is the opportunity to use a visual screening method based on colour change of the cervix tissue when exposed to acetic acid. This method causes abnormal cells to turn white upon interacting with acetic acid.

The cervix region is defined by the cervix boundary, the region of anatomical interest to us. A key landmark is the cervical os, which is a narrow opening from the uterus to the vagina that is usually clearly visible in our images.

### Potential identification problems
1. Image acquisition 
    a) Strong camera flash reflected in images
    b) Shadows 
    
2. Variability
    a) Viewing angles
    b) Cervical Size
    c) Instruments
    d) Non-cervix tissue 

## Multi-stage Identification procedure

Proprocessing -> Landmark Identification -> Cervical features -> Cervix Type

#### Proprocessing

1. Identification of cervix boundary
2. Identification of Spectral Reflections (SR)

## Landmark Identification

1. Cervix Boundary
2. OS

## Determining Transformation Zones


## Image Classification
